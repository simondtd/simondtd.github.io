                I was hired by Square Root Studios as a programmer in 2020
                to work on various gameplay features and systems for the game <a
                    href="https://titanreach.com">TitanReach</a>.
                To this day, TitanReach has gathered more than 170 000 USD through crowdfunding
                and is one of the biggest up and coming indie MMORPGs on the market.<br><br>

                Some of my responsibilities have been reworking the old UI, designing a style guide for the
                programming team, designing and implementing a new sound system and more.

                </div>

                Leaf is an exploration driven action-adventure game that I worked on from 2018 to 2019.
                Everything except sound effects and music made by me.
                The game was made with Unity, C#, Blender and Photoshop. I self-published the game
                on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1048960/Leaf/">Steam</a> in 2019.

                <br><br>Leaf features real-time action combat, inventory systems, statistics,
                analytics, enemy AI, boss fights and more in a persistent semi-open world.

                </div>

                Nonno Lorenzo is an action life- and farming simulator inspired by games like Stardew Valley and Harvest
                Moon.
                It is made with Unity, C# Blender and Photoshop and
                features building, crafting, action combat, inventory
                systems, statistics, analytics, enemy AI, procedural quest
                generation, simulation aspects and more.<br><br>

                It is set to release in late 2021 or early 2022.

                </div>

                Project N is a hobby project I made over the winter break in 2020, it is a prototype
                of a Nintendo inspired puzzle game borrowing mechanics from games like Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker,
                and Sokoban.<br><br>
                It is made with Unity, C# Blender and Photoshop.

                    <img src="img/project_nethus2.png">
                </div>

                Project: Nethus is a PvP and Trading focused MMORPG playable in a browser. The game is made
                together with Luke Shuster whom I met at university.<br><br>

                The frontend is made with React and the <a href="https://arwes.dev">Arwes</a> library. The backend is
                made with Asp.NET Core and SignalR which allows
                for real-time gameplay. It has GitHub hooks integration which deploys both the backend and frontend
                using docker.
                It has a persistent database that stores both user- and game data. The game engine is made by me using
                HTML Canvas and TypeScript
                with its own custom entity component system. There is a built in editor which stores solar systems in
                the backend database so that
                we can change the game world during run-time.
