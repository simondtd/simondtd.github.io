            I was hired by Square Root Studios as a programmer in 2020
            to work on various gameplay features and systems for the game <a href="https://titanreach.com">TitanReach</a>.
            To this day, TitanReach has gathered more than 170 000 USD through crowdfunding 
            and is one of the up and coming new indie MMORPGs.<br><br>

            Some of my responsibilities have been reworking the old UI, designing a style guide for the 
            programming team, designing and implementing a new sound system and more.

            Leaf is an exploration driven action-adventure game that I worked on from 2018 to 2019.
            Everything except sound effects and music made by me. 
            The game was made with Unity, C#, Blender and Photoshop. I self-published the game 
            on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1048960/Leaf/">Steam</a> in 2019

            <br><br>Leaf features real-time action combat, inventory systems, statistics,
            analytics, enemy AI, boss fights and more in a persistent semi-open world.

            Nonno Lorenzo is an action life- and farming simulator inspired by games like Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon.
            It is made with Unity, C# Blender and Photoshop and 
            features building, crafting, action combat, inventory
            systems, statistics, analytics, enemy AI, procedural quest
            generation, simulation aspects and more.<br><br>

            It is set to release in late 2021 or early 2022.

            Project N is a hobby project I made over the winter break in 2020, it is a prototype
            of a Nintendo inspired puzzle game borrowing mechanics from games like Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker, and Sokoban<br><br>
            It is made with Unity, C# Blender and Photoshop.

            </div>

            Project: Nethus is a PvP and Trading focused MMORPG playable in a browser. The game is made
            together with Luke Shuster whom I met at university.<br><br>

            The frontend is made with React and Arwes and the Backend is made with Asp.NET Core and SignalR which allows
            for real-time gameplay. It has GitHub hook integration which deploys both the backend and frontend using docker.
            It has a persistent database that stores both user data and game data. The game engine is self made using HTML Canvas and TypeScript
            with its own custom entity component system. There is a built in editor which stores solar systems in the backend database so that
            we can change the game world during run-time.
